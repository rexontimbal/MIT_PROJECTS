# Branch Copy Information

This branch, `claude/code-analysis-enhancement-011CV5g513pfQbHhCvwQRzKd`, is a direct working copy of the latest code bundle that was provided. There is no remote to verify against, so this snapshot is the only source of truth that currently exists inside the container.

To confirm what is available locally at any time, you can run:

```
git status -sb
git log --oneline -n 5
ls -a
```

When you are ready to branch off for new work, simply run `git checkout -b <new-branch>` from here—the new branch will inherit *exactly* the same files that shipped with the provided bundle.
